# AudioAddict.bundle

This is a Plex [Channel plugin](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/categories/200109616-Channels) that offers a nice interface to the [AudioAddict](http://www.audioaddict.com/) family of music streaming sites, including [DI.fm](http://di.fm), [RadioTunes.com](http://radiotunes.com) (formerly Sky.fm), and others.

# Install

Like most plugins, this is currently "[unsupported](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201375863-Channels-from-Other-Sources)", so the installation process is manual. See the [official Plex documentation](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201187656-How-do-I-manually-install-a-channel-) for more information.

# Preferences

There are some preferences that can be set:

* __Listen Key__: Your unique key, functionally used as an auth and ident token. It can be obtained from the "player settings â†’ hardware player" section of your favourite AA service. Example: http://www.radiotunes.com/settings
* __Preferred Streams__: These corresponds to the "sound quality & bandwidth" option of the AA service. AAC support is sort of wonky (works on some devices, not on others), so your only safe options (read: MP3) are `public3` and `premium_high` (except RockRadio, which uses `android_premium_high` for some reason).
* __Preferred Source__: This corresponds to the regional server that you want to stream. You're not obligated to set this, but if you're having bandwidth issues it might help. `pub1` and `prem1` are in the USA, `prem2` is in Europe, and `prem3` is in SE Asia (possibly Singapore).

# Does it work?

Yes! :smile: For reference, I run Plex on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS box, and I access it using the Android client, the Plex for Samsung TV app, and via Firefox on my MacBook.  Members of the [community](https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/107801-audioaddict-skyfm-difm-etc/) have reported success with Chromecast as well.
